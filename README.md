# QuickTime-Fixer
Mountain Lion QuickTime supports third party codecs. This means you can install Perian and play all sorts of videos! I wanted to use this version of QuickTime on Mavericks!

To my knowledge, everything works perfectly now, except for the audio slider (just change the system volume).
